# Introduction
In complex real-world scenarios, tasks often involve overlapping responsibilities and varied resources. To manage this complexity, workers need mechanisms to identify reusable sub-task patterns while handling unique tasks independently. This capability mirrors real-world problem-solving, where individuals streamline recurring tasks based on past experience while tackling novel challenges flexibly.

Streamline complex task design within a unified framework through domain knowledge distillation. By utilizing the frameworks - **TaskGraph**, the agent breaks down intricate processes into manageable tasks, further subdividing them into actionable steps or instructions. The **TaskGraph** serves as a blueprint, providing the guidelines, guardrails, strategies that ensure multiple workers collaborate reliably and efficiently, maintaining control while dynamically adapting to user needs.

Consider an e-commerce customer service agent that manage tasks such as answering inquiries, recommending products, managing orders, processing returns, and more. Each task involves different resources—company policies, product databases, user profiles, or third-party applications. The Task Planning Engine ensures every task follows best practices and consistent guidelines, guaranteeing reliability. At the same time, workers adapt dynamically to users’ personalized cases, creating a balance between structure and flexibility.
