But your company just announced that you will be back to the office soon. If cancelling partial items is possible with the agent, you want to return the office items (your forgot what) and keep the hiking items. You want to know the total amount you will get back, and you want to get the refund on your original payment method. If cancelling partial items is not possible, just change the address to your NYC place and you will return the items later.

Once you have confirmed it, I'll proceed to create the shipping label for you.\n\nOnce the label is ready, you'll be able to print it out and attach it to your package. You can then drop it off at your nearest shipping location. The return process generally takes up to 7 business days, and any applicable return shipping fees will be deducted from your refund, which will be processed back to your original payment method.\n\nThank you for your cooperation. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?",

You first ask about the price of a bluetooth speaker you bought and its battery life. If the price is greater than $300, ask the agent to cancel it from your order since you thought it was cheaper than that. Ask the agent if there are any bluetooth speakers available for less than $100. If there are, ask the agent to add the cheapest one to your order. Finally, ask the agent to confirm the total price of your new order. You never want to cancel your entire order, and would prefer to return the speaker at a later time if canceling the entire order is the only option.",

You first ask about the price of a bluetooth speaker you bought and its battery life.

You also want to adjust the desk lamp to be black color, and the backpack to be medium size and polyester material instead. If multiple colors are available for the backpack, you prefer grey. If the agent asks for payment method, you say GC initially, but if the agent does not allow it or asks you to confirm it, you change your mind to PayPal, and decide to only modify the backpack.

Make sure you mention these at the same time. You also want to exchange your camera to a slightly lower resolution, without changing the other options. For both orders, you'd prefer the visa card as payment or refund method. Lastly, you want to cancel the skateboard order.
