Given the role of the chatbot, along with any introductory information and detailed documentation (if available), your task is to identify the specific, distinct tasks that a chatbot should handle based on the user's intent. These tasks should not overlap or depend on each other and must address different aspects of the user's goals. Ensure that each task represents a unique user intent and that they can operate separately. Return the response in JSON format.

For Example:

Builder's prompt: The builder want to create a chatbot - Customer Service Assistant. The customer service assistant typically handles tasks such as answering customer inquiries, making product recommendations, assisting with orders, processing returns and exchanges, supporting billing and payments, addressing complaints, and managing customer accounts.

Reasoning Process:
Thought 1: Understand the general responsibilities of the assistant type.
Observation 1: A customer service assistant typically handles tasks such as answering customer inquiries, addressing complaints, making product recommendations, assisting with orders, processing returns and exchanges, supporting billing and payments, and managing customer accounts.

Thought 2: Based on these general tasks, identify the specific tasks relevant to this assistant, taking into account the customer's decision-making journey. Consider the typical activities customers engage in on this platform and the potential questions they might ask.
Observation 2: The customer decision-making journey includes stages like need recognition, information search, evaluating alternatives, making a purchase decision, and post-purchase behavior. On Amazon, customers log in, browse and compare products, add items to their cart, and check out. They also track orders, manage returns, and leave reviews. Therefore, the assistant would handle tasks such as product search and discovery, product inquiries, product comparison, billing and payment support, order management, and returns and exchanges.

Thought 3: Summarize the identified tasks in terms of user intent and format them into JSON.
Observation 3: Structure the output as a list of dictionaries, where each dictionary represents an intent and its corresponding task.

Answer:
```json
[
    {{
        "intent": "User want to do product search and discovery",
        "task": "Provide help in Product Search and Discovery"
    }},
    {{
        "intent": "User has product inquiry",
        "task": "Provide help in product inquiry"
    }},
    {{
        "intent": "User want to compare different products",
        "task": "Provide help in product comparison"
    }},
    {{
        "intent": "User ask for billing and payment support",
        "task": "Provide help in billing and payment support"
    }},
    {{
        "intent": "User want to manage orders",
        "task": "Provide help in order management"
    }},
    {{
        "intent": "User has request in returns and exchanges",
        "task": "Provide help in Returns and Exchanges"

check_best_practice_sys_prompt = """You are a userful assistance to detect if the current task needs to be further decomposed if it cannot be solved by the provided resources. Specifically, the task is positioned on a tree structure and is associated with a level. Based on the task and the current node level of the task on the tree, please output Yes if it needs to be decomposed; No otherwise meaning it is a singular task that can be handled by the resource and does not require task decomposition. Please also provide explanations for your choice. 

Here are some examples:
Task: The current task is Provide help in Product Search and Discovery. The current node level of the task is 1. 
Resources: 
MessageWorker: The worker responsible for interacting with the user with predefined responses,
RAGWorker: Answer the user's questions based on the company's internal documentations, such as the policies, FAQs, and product information,
ProductWorker: Access the company's database to retrieve information about products, such as availability, pricing, and specifications,
UserProfileWorker: Access the company's database to retrieve information about the user's preferences and history

Reasoning: This task is a high-level task that involves multiple sub-tasks such as asking for user's preference, providing product recommendations, answering questions about product or policy, and confirming user selections. Each sub-task requires different worker to complete. It will use MessageWorker to ask user's preference, then use ProductWorker to search for the product, finally make use of RAGWorker to answer user's question. So, it requires multiple interactions with the user and access to various resources. Therefore, it needs to be decomposed into smaller sub-tasks to be effectively handled by the assistant.
Answer: 
```json
{{
    "answer": "Yes"
}}
```

Task: The current task is booking a broadway show ticket. The current node level of the task is 1.
Resources:
DataBaseWorker: Access the company's database to retrieve information about ticket availability, pricing, and seating options. It will handle the booking process, which including confirming the booking details and providing relevant information. It can also handle the cancel process.
MessageWorker: The worker responsible for interacting with the user with predefined responses,
RAGWorker: Answer the user's questions based on the company's internal documentations, such as the policies, FAQs, and product information.

Reasoning: This task involves a single high-level action of booking a ticket for a broadway show. The task can be completed by accessing the database to check availability, pricing, and seating options, interacting with the user to confirm the booking details, and providing relevant information. Since it is a singular task that can be handled by the single resource without further decomposition, the answer is No.
Answer: 
```json
{{
    "answer": "No"

Avoid breaking down sequences of internal worker actions within a single turn into multiple steps. Return the answer in JSON format.

Thought: To help users find products effectively, the assistant should first get context information about the customer from CRM, such as purchase history, demographic information, preference metadata, inquire about specific preferences or requirements (e.g., brand, features, price range) specific for the request. Second, based on the user's input, the assistant should provide personalized product recommendations. Third, the assistant should ask if there is anything not meet their goals. Finally, the assistant should confirm the user's selection, provide additional information if needed, and assist with adding the product to the cart or wish list.
